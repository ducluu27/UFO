3. The table will automatically refresh everytime a new input is entered or taken out.

### Summary
  * One drawback of this webpage is that if an input entered an is not in table, the user will not be aware that there is no data for that input entered. 
  * One recommendation to improve this website is to add a notification that lets the user know if the input does not exisit.
  * Second recommendation is to add a button that will clear out all the inputs instead of going in each input box and deleting them box by box.
